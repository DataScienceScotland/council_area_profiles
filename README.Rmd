Rmarkdown to generate demographic profiles for each Scottish Council area.

## How it works
For each council area we create: data, plots, tables, and text. These elements are then knitted into an HTML document by an RMarkdown file. The whole process is controlled by a single script that loops over each council area.

## How to update
1. Make a copy of the most recent files
1. Update the data file
1. Update the code
    * Start and end years, last and next updates, etc
1. Run the script that loops over each council area
    * At the moment this takes several hours. So it's best to try one council area first.
1. Sense check the HTML document
1. Send a sample of HTML documents to the relevant Statistician for QA
1. Send all HTML documents to the web team to upload to the website
    * Email 10 zipped HTML documents at a time

## Room for improvement

In rough order of importance/urgency:

* Validate data before preparing tables (e.g. is every council area included? Should Scotland be included?)
* Simplify the code. For example:
    * Replace deeply nested `ifelse` with `case_when`
    * Use functions, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
    * Use [existing utilities](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/label_ordinal.html)
* Number files in the order they should be run
* Reduce the time it takes to run
    * This may be because some datasets are very large
    * A solution could be to create aggregate versions of a single dataset
* Improve/shorten variable names
* Separate data from code (i.e. dates)
* Improve comments (e.g. **why** not **what**)
* Simplify how data is read in from the spreadsheet ([example](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/readxl-workflows.html#iterate-over-multiple-worksheets-in* -a-workbook))
* Nest/tidy datasets so the environment is more managable
